# Bioinformatics Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of bioinformatics algorithms that I implemented as part of the **Bioinformatics Algorithms** course at **Carnegie Mellon University's Pre-College Program**. 

The course provided an introduction to computational methods and algorithmic approaches used in bioinformatics, emphasizing the importance of problem-solving skills in the analysis of biological data. 

## Course Information
The **Carnegie Mellon University Pre-College Program** in Computational Biology offered me the opportunity to explore how algorithms can be applied to solve real-world biological problems. Throughout the course, I worked on developing algorithms that are foundational to the field of bioinformatics.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into directories, each containing code implementations for different bioinformatics algorithms and methods I learned during the program. Each folder includes explanations and relevant comments to understand the logic behind the code.
